# Basic concepts of Machine Learning 

## 1.Componments of statistical learning
- supervised learning:learning a model and make the model outputs a good prediction for an given input.the dataset of the model should have a label
- unsupervised learning:make the computer to learn some internal rules itself.the dataset of unsupervised do not have any label
- semi-supervised learning:it's hard to tag large amount of data,SSL is a combination of supervised learing and unsupervised learning,
the dataset contains small amount of taged data(with label) and a large amount of data without label.
- reinforcement learning:supply an evalution of the action and the machine try itself to do a better action to make the evalution better

## 2.Basic concepts of supervised learning
- input space:
- output space
- feature space
- hypothesis space
